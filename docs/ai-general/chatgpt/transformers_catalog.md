# [Transformer models: an introduction and catalog — 2023 Edition](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/)

This post is now an [ArXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07730) that you can print and cite.

**Update 05/2023**

Another pretty large update after 4 months. I was invited to submit the [article] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07730) to a journal, so I decided to enlist some help from some LinkedIn colleages and completely revamp it. First off, we added a whole lot of new models, including e.g. many from the Llama family. Because of this, we also included a new image that includes all the newer models we have included since February 2023. Since some of those models are fine-tuned or intstruction-tuned, we went into explaining a bit more what is the difference between a fine-tuned and a pre-trained model, and added a section on that discussion. We also fixed some details on the catalog itself and added a field on the license status of each model, which has become very relevant recently. I also added quite a few links to similar surveys at the end of this post. Finally, there was a lot of editing throughout the paper that I have incorporated here too. Hope this makes it more useful!

Also, in case you are wondering why the catalog does not include GPT-4 or PALM-2, I explicitly decided not to include models for which there are no public details of the different elements needed to classify and understand them even at the most basic level.

Thanks so much to Ananth Sankar, Jie Bing, Praveen Kumar Bodigutla, Timothy J. Hazen, and Michaeel Kazi from LinkedIn for their help with this latest version!

**Update 01/16/2023**

Six months after my last update, it is clear that the world has been taken by storm by Transformers. Everyone is talking about [ChatGPT](https://amatriain.net/blog/chatGPT), so I thought I needed to add the models that got us there. I had already talked about GPTInstruct before, but I added [GPT3.5](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#gpt35) and [ChatGPT](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#chatgpt) as independent models although they don’t add too much to the former. I also added a couple of models from [Eleuther.ai](https://www.eleuther.ai/) and [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), the only two startups that seem to be even ready to challenge the OpenAI/Facebook/Google supremacy in language models. Because of what is happening with ChatGPT, I thought I should add the main competitors from the big labs: [Sparrow](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#Sparrow) from Deepmind/Google, and Blenderbot3 from Facebook. Speaking of startups though, there has been a lot of talk of [Stability.ai](https://stability.ai/), so I felt I needed to add a reference to [StableDiffusion](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#stablediffusion). Finally, and while not many details are known about [AlphaFold](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#alphafold)’s architeccture, I thought I should add a reference to it since the problem of protein folding is very important, and Deepmind’s accomplishment in this regard is huge.

Also, there are two concepts that are becoming more and more important in the recent success of Transformers: On the one hand, [RLHF](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#rlhf) (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for language models. On the other hand, [Diffusion models](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#diffusion). I added a brief section on both these topics.

Now that I am including over 50 Transformers I thought I should highlight those that for some reason I consider to be noteworthy. I hope the others don’t feel bad about it :-) I also felt that very often I was searching for Transformer model timelines and none was comprehensive enough, so I bit the bullet and added a [timeline view](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#Timeline) to the catalog.

Enjoy! And, as always, human feedback is welcomed.

# Why this post[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#why-this-post)

I have a terrible memory for names. In the past few years we have seen the meteoric appearance of dozens of models of the Transformer family, all of which have funny, but not self-explanatory, names. The goal of this post is to offer a short and simple catalog and classification of the most popular Transformer models. In other words, I needed a Transformers cheat-sheet and couldn’t find a good enough one online, so I thought I’d write my own. I hope it can be useful to you too.

# What are Transformers[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#what-are-transformers)

Transformers are a class of deep learning models that are defined by some architectural traits. They were first introduced in he now famous [Attention is All you Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper by Google researchers in 2017 (the paper has accumulated a whooping 38k citations in only 5 years) and associated [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)) by Google researchers in 2017. The paper has accumulated a whopping 38k citations in only 5 years.

The original Transformer architecture is a specific instance of the [encoder-decoder models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-long-short-term-memory-networks/) that had become popular just over the 2–3 years prior. Up until that point however, attention was just one of the mechanisms used by these models, which were mostly based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and other RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) variations. The key insight of the Transformers paper, as the title implies, was that attention could be used as the only mechanism to derive dependencies between input and output.

The input to the Transformer is a sequence of tokens. The output of the encoder is a fixed-dimensional representation for each of the tokens along with a separate embedding for the sequence as a whole. The decoder takes the output of the encoder as input, and spits out a sequence of tokens as its output. In natural language processing (NLP), the tokens can be words or subwords. Subwords are used in all popular Transformer NLP models because they enable us to address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue that is inherent in a word-based system. For simplicity, we will use the term "token" to refer to the items in the input and output sequences, understanding that these tokens are subwords for NLP systems. When Transformers are used for processing images or video, the tokens can represent sub-images or objects.

Since the publication of the paper, popular models like BERT and GPT have used only the encoder or decoder aspects of the original architecture. The core commonality of these models is, thus, not the encoder-decoder aspect, but, rather, the architecture of the individual layers in the encoders and decoders. The layer architecture of Transformers is based on a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward layer, the core aspect of this being that each input token flows through the layers in its own path, while, at the same time, being directly dependent on every other token in the input sequence. This enables parallel and direct computation of contextual token representations which was previously not possible with sequential models like RNNs.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into all the details of the Transformer architecture. For that, we will refer you to the original paper or to [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) post. That being said, we will briefly describe the most important aspects since we will be referring to them in the catalog below. Let’s start with the basic architectural diagram from the original paper, and describe some of the components.

![img](https://amatriain.net/blog/images/02-02.png)

## Encoder/Decoder architecture[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#-encoderdecoder-architecture)

A generic encoder/decoder architecture (see Figure [2](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#fig:transformer) is composed of two models. The encoder takes the input and encodes it into a fixed-length vector. The decoder takes that vector and decodes it into the output sequence. The encoder and decoder are jointly trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of the output given the input. Once trained, the encoder/decoder can generate an output given an input sequence or can score a pair of input/output sequences.

In the case of the original Transformer architecture, both encoder and decoder had 6 identical layers. In each of those 6 layers the Encoder had two sub layers: a multi-head self attention layer, and a simple feed forward network. The self attention layer computes the output representation of each of its input tokens based on *all the input tokens*. Each sublayer also has a residual connection and a layer normalization. The output representation size of the Encoder was 512. The multi-head self-attention layer in the decoder is slightly different than that in the encoder. It masks all tokens to the right of the token whose representation is being computed so as to ensure that the decoder can only attend to tokens that come before the token it is trying to predict. This is shown in Figure [2](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#fig:transformer) as "masked multi-head attention." The Decoder also added a third sublayer, which is another multi-head attention layer over all the outputs of the Encoder. Note that all those specific details have since been modified in the many Transformer variations we will discuss. For example, as we noted before, models like BERT and GPT are based on only the encoder or decoder.

## Attention[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#attention)

It is clear from the description above that the only “exotic” elements of the model architecture are the multi-head attention layers, but, as described above, that is where the whole power of the model lies! So, what is attention anyway? An attention function is a mapping between a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. Each token in the input to the attention layer is converted to a query, key and value using three corresponding matrices. The output representation of each token is computed as a weighted sum of the values of all the tokens, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of its associated key and the query of the token whose representation is being computed. The compatibility function used in Transformers is just a scaled dot product. A key aspect of this attention mechanism in Transformers is that each token flows through its own computation path, thus lending itself to parallel computation of the representation of all the tokens in the input sequence. Now that we understand how attention works, what is multi-head attention? Well, that is just multiple attention blocks independently computing representations for each token. All these representations are then aggregated to give the final representation of the token. We will refer you again to the [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) for many more details on how the attention mechanism works, but will reproduce the diagram from the original paper in Figure [3](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#fig:attention) so you get the main idea.

![The Attention Mechanism from. (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention, (right) Multi-Head Attention](https://amatriain.net/blog/images/02-03.png)

There are several advantages of attention layers over recurrent and convolutional networks, the two most important being their lower computational complexity and their higher connectivity, especially useful for learning long-term dependencies in sequences.

## Foundation vs Fine-tuned models[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#foundation-vs-fine-tuned-models)

A foundation model is defined as "any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks” (see paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)) . When the foundation model is further trained on a small amount of target-specific data, it is called a [fine-tuned model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) because it has been fine-tuned to the specifics of the task at hand.

The [BERT paper](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) popularized this approach of pretraining and finetuning for natural language processing, resulting in many researchers using this approach for many different tasks. As a consequence, most of the leaderboards for any language-related machine leartning (ML) task became completely dominated by some version of the Transformer architecture (see for example the well known [SQUAD leaderboard](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer) for question answering or the [GLUE leaderboard](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard) for general language understanding, where all systems at the top employ Transformer-based models).

In its original usage, "fine-tuning" referred to tweaking a foundation model for a specific task, such as spam classification or question answering. Models, such as BERT, produce representations of the input tokens, but do not, by themselves, accomplish any task. Thus, it is necessary to fine-tune them by adding extra neural layers on top of the foundation model and training the model end to end.

With generative models like GPT, things are a little different. GPT is a decoder language model trained to predict the next token of a sentence given all the previous tokens. By training on huge amounts of web corpora covering almost any topic one can think about, it was found that GPT could actually produce reasonable outputs to input queries or prompts. GPT accomplished this by simply predicting the next token given the input prompt sequence and the output sequence GPT had already predicted. This language generation actually did a somewhat reasonable job of tasks like answering questions about general web knowledge, writing poems etc. Notwithstanding, GPT’s outputs were often untruthful or really not very helpful to the user. To address this, OpenAI researchers came up with the idea of training GPT to [follow human instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) . The resulting models are called InstructGPT. The authors did this by using a small amount of human-labeled data from a large variety of tasks to further train GPT. As before, this is a "fine-tuning" process, but the resulting Instruct GPT model is capable of doing a wide range of tasks, and is, in fact, the class of models used by the popular ChatGPT engine. Since these models can accomplish a myriad of tasks, we refer to them as foundation models.

Such additional fine-tuning has been used to generate other general purpose model variants as well, specifically designed for uses cases beyond language modeling (predicting the next token in a sequence). For example, there is a subclass of models fined-tuned to learn text string embeddings optimized for semantic-relatedness, making them directly useful for higher-level semantic tasks (e.g. text classification, clustering, search retrieval, etc.). Examples include [OpenAI’s text embedding models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings}, [E5](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large), and [InstructOR](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-xl). Transformer encoders have also been successfully fined-tuned within multi-task learning frameworks to be able to perform [multiple different semantic tasks using a single shared Transformer model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11038).

Thus, as we see, while originally foundation models were fine-tuned for very specific target tasks for specific groups of users, today fine-tuning is used to also create further versions of foundation models that can be used by a huge number of users. The process used by ChatGPT and similar dialog agents, like BlenderBot3 or Sparrow, is fairly simple: Given a pretrained language model like GPT, we use it to generate different responses to input prompts (or instructions) and have humans rank the results. We then use those rankings (aka preferences or feedback) to train a reward model. The reward model attaches a score to each output for a given input instruction. After this, a reinforcement learning with human feedback [(RLHF) process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) is used to train the model on more input instructions, but, rather than use a human to generate the feedback, the reward model is used to rank the outputs of the model. You can read much more in these two wonderful posts by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) and [Ayush Thakur](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/RLHF/reports/Understanding-Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback-RLHF-Part-1--VmlldzoyODk5MTIx).

## The impact of Transformers[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#the-impact-of-transformers)

The application demonstrated in the original Transformer paper was language translation. This seminal work also showed the architecture generalized well to other language tasks. Over the next several months, researchers figured out that Transformers could be used to capture a lot of inherent knowledge about language by pretraining them on a very large amount of unsupervised text. The knowledge captured in these models could then be transferred to target tasks by training on a small amount of labeled data.

While original Transformers were designed for language tasks, the same Transformer architecture has been applied to many other applications like the generation of images, audio, music, or even actions. Because of that, Transformers are considered a key, if not the key, component to the new wave of the so-called "Generative AI". Generative AI and its many applications are already revolutionizing many aspects of society (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00340-6) and [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=4337484), for example).

Of course all these applications would not have been possible but for the myriad of tools that made them readily available to anyone that could write a few lines of code. Not only were Transformers quickly integrated into the main AI frameworks (namely [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer)), but they even enabled the creation of an entire company around them. [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs), a startup that has raised over $ 60M to this day, is almost entirely built around the idea of commercializing their open source [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

Transformer model adoption is further accelerated as specialized hardware is developed by commercial players to improve model training and inference speed. NVIDIA’s [Hopper Tensor Cores](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet) can apply mixed FP8 and FP16 precisions to dramatically accelerate AI calculations for Transformers.

Last but not least, we would be remiss if we did not mention the impact of ChatGPT on the popularization of Transformers. ChatGPT was released by OpenAI in November 2022, and became the fastest growing app in history, reaching 1 million users in less than a month, and 100 million in [less than two](https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/article.1585717.html). ChatGPT was originally a chatbot application built on top of the [Instruct-GPT model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) also called GPT-3.5. Not much later, OpenAI announced the release of the more powerful [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), which [achieves human level capabilities in tasks such as passing the USMLE exam for medical doctors or the bar exam for lawyers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) .

## A Note on Diffusion Models[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#a-note-on-diffusion-models)

Diffusion models have become the new state-of-the-art in image generation, clearly pushing aside the previous approaches such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). It is important to note, though, that the diffusion mechanism is not dependent on the Transformer architecture. However, most modern diffusion approaches do include a Transformer backbone .

Diffusion models are a class of latent variable models trained through variational inference. What this means in practice is that we train a deep neural network to denoise images blurred with some sort of noise function. Networks that are trained this way are in fact learning the latent space of what those images represent (see Figure [4](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#fig:diffusion).

![Probabilistic diffusion model architecture from "Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications,"](https://amatriain.net/blog/images/diffusion.png)

Diffusion models have relation to other generative models like Denoising Autoencoders and the famous Generative Adversarial Networks [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), which they have mostly replaced in many applications. Some [authors](https://benanne.github.io/2022/01/31/diffusion.html) will go as far as saying that Diffusion models are just a specific instance of autoencoders. However, they also admit that the small differences do transform their application, from the latent representation of autoencoders to the pure generative nature of Diffusion models.

# The Transformers catalog[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#the-transformers-catalog)

## Features of a Transformer[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#features-of-a-transformer)

So hopefully by now you understand what Transformer models are, and why they are so popular and impactful. In this section we will introduce a catalog of the most important Transformer models that have been developed to this day. We will categorize each model according to the following properties: Family, Pretraining Architecture, Pretraining or Fine-tuning Task, Extension, Application, Date (of first known publication), Number of Parameters, Corpus, License, and Lab. Some are relative simple to understand: *Family* represents what original foundation model the specific model is extending, *extension* describes what the model is adding to the one it is deriving from, *Date* is when the model was firts published, *Number of parameters* of the pretrained model, *Corpus* is what data sources the model was pre-trained or fine-tuned on, *License* describes how the model can be legally used, and *Lab* lists the institution that published the model. The remaining propterties deserve a bit more explanation. We do that in the paregraphs that follow:

### Pretraining Architecture[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#pretraining-architecture)

We described the Transformer architecture as being made up of an Encoder and a Decoder, and that is true for the original Transformer. However, since then, different advances have been made that have revealed that in some cases it is beneficial to use only the encoder, only the decoder, or both.

**Encoder Pretraining**

These models, which are also called bi-directional or auto-encoding, only use the encoder during pretraining, which is usually accomplished by masking tokens in the input sentence and training the model to reconstruct those tokens. At each stage during pretraining, self-attention layers can access all their input tokens. This family of models are most useful for tasks that require understanding complete sentences or passages, such as text classification, entailment, and extractive question answering.

**Decoder Pretraining**

Decoder models use only the decoder during a pretraining. They are also called auto-regressive language models because they are trained to predict the next token based on the previous sequence of tokens.

The self-attention layers can only access the tokens positioned before a given token in the sentence. They are best suited for tasks involving text generation.

**Transformer (Encoder-Decoder) Pretraining**

Encoder-decoder models, also called sequence-to-sequence, use both parts of the Transformer architecture.

Self-attention layers of the encoder can access all their input tokens, while the self-attention layers of the decoder can only access the tokens positioned before a given token. As explained before, the additional attention layer in the decoder enables access to all encoder token representations.

An encoder-decoder model can be pre-trained by optimizing denoising objectives or a combination of denoising and causal language modeling objectives . These objective functions are complex in comparison to the ones used to pretrain encoder only or decoder only models. The encoder-decoder models are best suited for tasks revolving around generating new sentences depending on a given input, such as summarization, translation, or generative question answering.

### Pretraining Task[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#pretraining-task)

When training a model we need to define a task for the model to learn on. Some of the typical tasks, such as predicting the next word or learning to reconstruct masked words were already mentioned above. “[Pre-trained Models for Natural Language Processing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08271)” includes a pretty comprehensive taxonomy of pretraining tasks, all of which can be considered self-supervised:

When training a model we need to define an objective, or task, for the model to learn on. Some of the typical tasks, such as predicting the next token or learning to reconstruct masked tokens were already mentioned above. “Pre-trained Models for Natural Language Processing: A Survey” includes a pretty comprehensive taxonomy of pretraining tasks, all of which can be considered self-supervised:

1. **Language Modeling (LM):** Predict the next token (in the case of unidirectional LM) or the previous and next token (in the case of bidirectional LM).
2. **Causal Language Modeling (Causality-masked LM):** Autoregressively (left-to-right, in general) predict a text sequence, similar to unidirectional LM.
3. **Prefix Language Modeling (Prefix LM):** In this task, a separate ‘prefix’ section is separated from the main sequence. Within the prefix, any token can attend to any other token (non-causal). Outside of the prefix, decoding proceeds autoregressively.
4. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Mask out some tokens from the input sentences and then train the model to predict the masked tokens using the surrounding context.
5. **Permuted Language Modeling (PLM):** Same as LM, but on a random permutation of input sequences. A permutation is randomly sampled from all possible permutations. Then some of the tokens are chosen as the target, and the model is trained to predict these targets.
6. **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE):** Take a partially corrupted input and aim to recover the original, undistorted input. Examples of corrupted input include randomly sampling tokens from the input and replacing them with "[MASK]" elements, randomly deleting tokens from the input, or shuffling sentences in random order.
7. **Replaced Token Detection (RTD):** Using a "generator" model, randomly replace certain tokens in the text. The "discriminator" is tasked to predict whether a token comes from the original text, or the generator model.
8. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Train the model to distinguish whether two input sentences are continuous segments from the training corpus.

Note that in the case of fine-tuned models, this property is used to describe the task the model was fine-tuned to, not how it was pre-trained.

### Application[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#application)

Here we will note what are the main practical applications of the Transformer model. Most of these applications will be in the language domain (e.g. question answering, sentiment analysis, or entity recognition). However, as mentioned before, some Transformer models have also found applications well beyond NLP and are also included in the catalog.

### Catalog table[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#catalog-table)

**Note:** For all the models available in Huggingface, I decided to directly link to the page in the documentation since they do a fantastic job of offering a consistent format and links to everything else you might need, including the original papers. Only a few of the models (e.g. GPT3) are not included in Huggingface.

![img](https://amatriain.net/blog/images/02-04.png)

You can access the original table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ltyrAB6BL29cOv2fSpNQnnq2vbX8UrHl47d7FkIf6t4/edit#gid=0) for easier browsing across the different model features. The full list of models is included below.

### Family Tree[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#family-tree)

The diagram below is a simple view that should highlight the different families of transformers and how they relate to each other.

### Chronological timeline[Permalink](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#chronological-timeline)

Another interesting perspective of the catalog is to see it as a chronological timeline. Here you will find all the transformers in the catalog sorted by their date of publication. In this first visualization, the Y-axis is only used to cluster transformers of related heritage/family.

![img](https://amatriain.net/blog/images/02-06.png)

In this next visualization, the Y-axis represents model size in millions of parameters. You won’t be able to see all the models in the catalog since many fall right on the same time and size, so please refer to the previous image for that.

Since the introduction of chatGPT, the LLM open-source community has experienced a significant surge in activity. With each passing week, we have observed a proliferation of refined models fine-tuned using the latest technologies. As a result, these models are continuously improving, growing more robust and powerful. Figure [10](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/#fig:finetunedModels) demonstrates the recent emerged models since Feb, 2023.

Most of the following references have already been mentioned in the post. However, it is worth listing them here in case you need more details:

- The Huggingface Transformers [documentation](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1?fw=pt) and course is extremely good and comprehensive. I have used myself in this post, and I can’t recommend enough as a natural follow up to what you will find here.
- [A survey of transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04554) (Lin et al. 2021) includes a 40 page long survey wit over 170 references and a full blown taxonomy.

There are a few surveys specificially focused on LLMs. Here a afew worth checking out:

- [Pre-trained Models for Natural Language Processing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08271) (Quiu et al. 2021) is another 30+ pages long survey that focuses on pretrained models for NLP.
